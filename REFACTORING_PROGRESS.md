## 📜 Detailed Progress Checklist

### **M0 · Baseline** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **m0.1** Create safety branch & run current code
  - ✅ Branch `refactor/start` created
  - ✅ Baseline tests executed and saved to `artefacts/baseline_tests.txt`
  - ✅ Repository state recorded
  - **Status**: DONE

---

### **M1 · Platform Layer** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **m1.1** Create folders & stubs
  - ✅ Created `platform_utils/` directory (renamed from `platform/` to avoid stdlib conflicts)

---

### **M2 · Dependency Governance** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **m2.1** Edit `pyproject.toml`
  - ✅ Added `[project.optional-dependencies]`
  - ✅ `desktop = ["plyer"]` - working correctly
  - ✅ `android = []` - pyjnius temporarily disabled due to Python 3.13 compatibility
  - ✅ Desktop dependencies tested: `uv run --extra desktop python -c "import plyer"` ✅ 
  - ✅ Platform abstraction tested and working
  - ✅ Created `PYTHON_313_COMPATIBILITY.md` documenting known issues
  - **Status**: DONE (with documented limitations)

**Notes**:
